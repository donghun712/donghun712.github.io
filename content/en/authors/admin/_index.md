I am Donghun Kim, an undergraduate in the School of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence at Jeonbuk National University.
Through coursework and projects, I am building strong fundamentals with a focus on databases and algorithms.
I practice schema design and basic query optimization regularly using MySQL.
To reinforce necessary concepts, I steadily study the mathematical foundations such as linear algebra.
Even for small tasks, I work on separate Git branches and keep the history organized to avoid conflicts.
From a digital logic course, I implemented two‚Äôs complement and adder concepts in code.
When solving problems, I prefer breaking them into reproducible steps and addressing them systematically.
I study while keeping an eye on GPA and scholarship requirements, and I work to maintain and improve my skill set.
My interests include databases, algorithms, and the mathematics that underpins them.
In team projects, I prefer clear role definition and take responsibility for schedule management.
